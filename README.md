# Code-Quiz
Code-Quiz is a series of Web Development coding trivia questions. 

1. When the player starts the quiz, the one minute timer begins to count down.

2. If they answer correctly, they will see "Correct"! 
    * But if the answer is wrong, they will see "Wrong!", and 10 seconds will be deducted from the current time on the timer!

2. When all questions are answered OR the timer reaches 0, then the game is over, & they will get a message saying "Game Over!".

3. They will then be able to add their initals to get saved to "High Scores".
